<b>Ignited Minds</b>: Unleashing the Power Within India (2002, ISBN 0-670-04928-X) is a book written by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, who was the President of India from 2002 to 2007.
[1][2] <b>Ignited Minds</b> is a logical step forward from Dr. Kalam's earlier book, India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium (1998, ISBN 0-670-88271-2). This book consists
of many inspirational messages by A P J Abdul Kalam.
Dr. Kalam has dedicated <b>Ignited Minds</b> to an intermediate school child, named Snehal Thakkar, whom he met at a school and while talking to his students, a question had come
up: "Who is our enemy?". Kalam recalled that many answers came up, but the answer on which all agreed came from his (Snehal Thakkar): "Our enemy is poverty". The small book
of 205 pages contains dynamic and original ideas, examines attitudes afflicting the Indians, and present prescriptions for rapid growth of India to enable the country to
emerge as a developed country. The scientist and the seer inside Kalam has addressed the book to young citizen(s) of India. This book has been the most wanted and demanded
all over the world after the death of Abdul Kalam.
The book is organised into eleven chapters, dealing with various issues. These chapters are: <br>
<br><b>1 .</b> The Dreams and the Message
<br><b>2 .</b> Give Us a Role Model
<br><b>3 .</b> Visionary Teachers and Scientists
